**Smart Grid and Power System Analysis (April 2015​-June 2016)**

At this project,My advisor was Murat Gol,who is Asso.Profesor at METU.In this project,my aim was a Enhancement of State Estimator for Power Systems Measurement.Firstly to be able to understand a Grid,I tried to create an environment where the whole connectivity matrices , measurement matrices(Sparse Matrices) can be declared by Knuth’s Method. After implementing that by using C++ OOP than  analyzed a real Grid try to find admittance matrix of the grid.Now I try to analyze the grid or the network it is observable or not.

**Data Measurement System(November 2015­-?)**

At this project ,My advisor was Murat Gol and Ozan Keysan ,who are Asso.Professors in METU.In the project,our(Advisors and the other group members) main object is construct a portable grid measurement device.My main job is ,draw and test the Measurement PCB and try to determine which algorithm will be used in that device and than imply them.I am using C++ for algorithm implementation and I used Altium for PCB design.I did 4 layer measurement PCB with the help of Mesut Ugur who is research assistant. Than , I wrote some communication drivers for DSP.

**RIoT(Wi-Fi Controlled Smart Laboratory)(June 2016-?)**

At this Project,My advisor was Murat Gol who is Asso.Professor in METU and I worked with group called IEEE RAS METU which the former chair was me. In the Project, We tried to construct a smart laboratory which power line can be controlled by using Wi-Fi and so step-by-step we can construct a human companion robotic laboratory . Our main object is analyzing whole flat grid and so construct an embedded based control system to achieve the object . We were using Lua programming language based NodeMCU and python,C++ to control Raspberry Pi based scripts. Because the Project is ongoing that is all about Project declaration .

**Modelling a DC Motor Drive System(March 2017-April 2017)** 

In this project my advisor was Ozan Keysan who is Asso.Professors in METU and this project was our lecture(EE462) project. My objectives was,
 
- Modeling a DC motor drive system using various techniques

- Building a simple DC motor drive on your own

- Analyzing of the electrical and mechanical characteristics


**Modeling a four-quadrant chopper DC-motor drive system for Metro Traction System(April 2017-April 2017)**

In this project my advisor was Ozan Keysan who is Asso.Professors in METU and this project was our lecture(EE462) project.My objectives was,

- Modeling and simulation of four-quadrant DC motor drives with power electronics

- Applying open-loop and closed-loop control

- Circuit design and component selection

- DC motor modes of operation

**Design of Induction Motor Drive (Upcoming)**

In this project my advisor was Ozan Keysan who is Asso.Professors in METU and this project was our lecture(EE462) project.My objectives was,

- Characterization of the motor from the given data
- Designing induction motor drive system for a specific application

	- Drive topology proposition

	- Power stage design
	
	- Control system design

- Modeling and simulation of the proposed design in MATLAB/Simulink

- Applying open-loop control for different operating modes

- Performance evaluation of the designed drive system

- Applying closed-loop control

Currently , I am interested in Robots Motor Drive and I try to understand some different robot kinematics and dynamics . Now I try to model SLIP(Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum) dynamics and do some simulation on it.
