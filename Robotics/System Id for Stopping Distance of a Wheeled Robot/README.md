# Quick Intro

In this project, a characterisation test for stopping distances for a mobile robot has been studied. The project uses different software components to achieve that given goal. The project is consists of:
-  **(simulation_dev)** ROS and Gazebo: to mimic a behavior of a mobile robot and acquire some data. 
-  **analysis** Jupyter-notebook: to let the user to interact with the steps of how the data has been processed and provide figures to give the actual intuition about what is going on! 

I quite enjoyed the project, but it is such a vaguely defined definition of done which makes it really difficult to stop thinking about it. My approach is always, first infrastracture than boom boom!

So, thanks a lot for all the amazing people build those tools and softwares!
