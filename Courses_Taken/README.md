This section is to summarise which courses have been taken by me during MSc and BSc. As one can notice a lot of courses from different specialised topic has been taken to build more concrete and versatile engineering background.

# Course List

- EE441 / **Data Structures**

This course primarily aims to acquaint the student with basic data structures frequently used in software engineering and programming practices. 

Concepts of object-oriented programming, abstract data types, dynamic memory management and algorithm complexity are given. Searching and sorting algorithms are also discussed.

- EE447 / **Introduction to Microprocessors**

This course aims to broaden the horizon of the student about various Microprocessor architecture and focuses on a particular microprocessor software. Concepts of I/O interfacing,

Interrupt processed I/O, Direct memory access and Microprocessor based communications are given as well. Various hardware projects are also implemented to extend student know-how about

embedded systems and gain handzone experience

- EE462 / Utilisation of Electrical Energy 

This course aims to extend know-how of the student about Basic operating characteristics and classification of electrical drives, Solid state DC motor control, Solid state AC motor control, Dynamic behavior of electrical machines, Electric braking. 

Concepts of Starting of electrical machines, Intermittent loads, different motor Drive applications, Modern methods of reactive power compensation, Electrical energy saving and wind turbine drive system are also covered.

Some of the example project can be found in the Portfolio repo.

- CENG786 / **Robot Motion Planning and Control**

This course aims to introduce students to basic concepts of motion planning, including representations of state and movement, potential functions, roadmaps, cell decompositions, basic robot dynamics and control, 

constrained motion, randomized planning methods, hybrid planning and control, logical reasoning methods for planning. 

Projects done for that course can be found inside the Portfolio repo.

- CENG787 / Robotic Locomotion: Models and Algorithms Legged Locomotion

This course aims to introduce students to Basic concepts of locomotion, review of mathematical methods for modeling and analysis, free-body analysis, Lagrangian dynamics, dynamical stability, limit cycles, 

traditional wheeled and tracked robot morphologies, kinematic legged locomotion, zero-moment-point algorithms, neural control concepts, coordination of limbs and joints, exoskeletons, dynamic legged locomotion, 

reduced models, passive dynamic walking, spring-mass running models, hybrid zero-dynamics, snake robots, locomotion based on non-holonomic dynamics, aerial and underwater locomotion. 

Projects done for that course can be found inside the Portfolio repo.

- IAM561 / **Introduction to Scientific Computing**

This course is intended for relatively new graduate students who require knowledge of and background in numerical methods. At the end of this course, the student will:
 - understand the errors, source of error and its effect on any numerical computations, and also analyse the efficiency of any numerical algorithms
 - learn how to obtain numerical solution of nonlinear equations
 - learn how to approximate the functions using interpolating polynomials
 - learn how to numerically differentiate and integrate functions
 - learn to implement the numerical methods using MATLAB

- EE553 / **Optimisation**

This course aims to introduce students to Mathematical preliminaries on functions of several variables, Convexity and convex functions, Unconstrained minimization problems, 

Computational algorithms such as steepest descent, Newton and quasi-Newton methods. Concepts of Constrained minimization problems and Kuhn-Tucker theory and Fundamental theorems of linear optimization and the simplex algorithm 

are also covered.

Some of the projects done for that course can be found inside the Portfolio repo.

- EE555 / **Stability Theory Of Dynamical Systems**  

The students taking the course are exposed to some of the basic tools that are used in stability analysis of dynamical systems. The objective of the course therefore is to make the students familiar with such tools for two reasons: 

The first obvious reason is that via such tools they will be able to do stability analysis in certain simple, generic cases. The second reason is, whenever the system they are working on does not fit into the description which is 

necessary for the tools to be usable, they can, based on their basic training they recieve in this course, move on to learning (by themselves) more sophisticated methods for advanced stability analysis.     

Some of the projects done for that course can be found inside the Portfolio repo.

I took the courses mentioned above during my undergraduate and graduate period. Unfortunately, I quit my MSc because of some difficulties and challenges faced during thesis writing period. 

So that, I am graduated from Sensor Fusion Nanodegree program to broaden my horizon about latest development about robotics.
